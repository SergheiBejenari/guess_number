# 🎯 Guess the Number (CLI Game)

A fun, interactive console game where the computer picks a secret number, and you try to guess it!  
The game gives you helpful feedback like "cold", "warm", "hot", and more, based on how close your guess is.

---

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python -m src.cli.main
   ```

2. Enter a **minimum** and **maximum** whole number for the range (e.g., 1–100).

3. Try to guess the number — the game will guide you:
    - ❄️ "Freezing cold"
    - 🧊 "Cold"
    - 🌤 "Warm"
    - 🔥 "Hot"
    - 🔥🔥 "Burning hot"

4. You’ll also get:
    - ✅ Messages like **"You’re getting warmer!"** if you’re moving in the right direction
    - ❌ Warnings like **"You're getting colder..."** if you're moving away from the number
    - 📣 After 3 bad guesses in a row, the game gives you a directional hint: **Try Higher / Lower**
